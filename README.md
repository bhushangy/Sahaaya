# Sahaaya
Sahaaya is a Flutter Application that serves as a platform for people to report the
problems they face in their neighborhood to the concerned government organization
and get a speedy response. 

Unlike existings apps where your complaint goes un-noticed or ignored,here we rank each neighbourhood 
based on their performance and also give them a rating wherein a compalint that is not resolved within 
a stipulated amount of leads to decrease in the rating of the neighbourhood which is done with the sole 
purpose of inducing more competency in the system.
